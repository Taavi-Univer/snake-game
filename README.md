# Snake Game

The player controls a square on a bordered plane. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border or itself. Player must attempt to eat items by running into them with the head of the snake. Each item eaten makes the snake longer, so avoiding collision with the snake becomes progressively more difficult.
